# simpletaskapp
This Python-based project presents a simple yet practical way of managing a To-Do list in the command line interface. This is a text-based to-do list where you can add, remove, and view tasks. The list of tasks is not persisted once the program is exited, making it suitable for quick, temporary lists.
